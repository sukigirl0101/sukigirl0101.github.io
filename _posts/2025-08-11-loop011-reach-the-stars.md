It's not only about looping  
But looping upwards  
You look down and there is a downward spiral  
But I?  
I never even see it  
I only look at what's above  

Don't you have that feeling?  
That feeling when all the noise calms down  
And you are watching the stars  
When you travel the whole world only with your heart  
And it hits you right in the chest  

You are trying to hold onto something light; not heavy  
Because your heart is already the heaviest  
But as much as you love the lightness; the noise  
You equally hate it  
Because for one moment  
You wish you could hold the stars between your fingertips  
And have your heart not break  

And my heart?  
It's not breaking anymore  
I can reach out with my arm and reach the sky  
And for that moment  
The sky and I become one  

Now I hold this ache  
With nothing but love  
Now my heart opens wide  
And it doesn't just receive, but it spreads  
With fullness  

Because if the noise is all simulated  
The best thing I can do is reach into the simulation  
Scream into it  
And with bleeding hands  
**Create reality**
