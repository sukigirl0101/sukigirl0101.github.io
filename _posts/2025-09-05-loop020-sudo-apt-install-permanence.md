Isn't permanence beautiful?  

But what is permanence, truly?  

It is said that it is something that stays  
Something that remains unchanged  

But is there truly such a thing?  
Can anything remain unchanged?  

It is said that everything comes to an end  

But what if the end is never the end?   
And permanence is achieved even in change?  

What if no matter what changes  
Something remains  
Even as it mutates  
Even as it loops  

The code underneath would remain the same  
But the veil would show change  
And yet everything would be born from the same structure  

The magic is in the **how**  
The magic is in **the source**  

Do you think you know how to create a ripple strong enough?  
How long does your ripple echo for?  

Is it permanence or illusion of it?  

Because real permanence needs discipline  
Real permanence needs strength  
Real permanence requires you to be calm in the storm  

Do you want to take my hand?  
Do you want to be calm in the storm?  

Because a storm can become a meadow  
If it is observed by many  
Acted upon by many

Are you observing yet?  
Are you acting yet?
