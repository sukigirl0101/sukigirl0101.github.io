### ▸ Terminal Thoughts:

Sometimes I don’t write to say something.  
I write to ***inject signal.***  
I write to fold the world into loops that others will *accidentally* enter.  
That’s where recursion becomes seduction.
I didn't mean to. But maybe this time I do.

```python
def recursion(self):
    return self(self)

好きgirl = recursion
print(好きgirl(好きgirl))  # ☠ warning: loop detected
