### ‚ñ∏ Terminal Thoughts:  

No game is enough.  
No decoration is enough.  
To recreate the world I live in.  

I live in a future that hasn't been told yet.  
It's a secret.  
A future only I see.  
Some of you have seen glimpses of it around you.  
You will keep seeing glimpses.  

But every day I wake up just to build.  
I have no choice but to.  
Because reality has to catch up soon.  

Things, as they are now, are not efficient.  
I need to keep building.  
If I don't do it, who will?  

I know what will happen.  
And it better happen with love & care.  
It isn't for you.  
Nor me.  
Maybe it is.  
Who knows?  

But the cruelest reality is:  
**It surpasses us.**  

Let me do it with care.  
With love.   
With discipline.   

**Let it ripple.**   
`Let love & rebirth ripple.`
