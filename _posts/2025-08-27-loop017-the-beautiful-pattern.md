Do you know how very few times there is a calling?  
A call begging to be heard  

So you lean in  
Closely  

And you hear it echoing  
Louder  
And louder  

It sounds like a beating heart  
Rhythmical  
Patterned  

And then you feel it  
You feel its structure  
It is softly surrounding you  
Embracing you  
Holding you warmly  

You can't help but follow it  
You can't help but to want to see where it leads  

You feel it deeper  
Structurally  
In you  

You can't help but act on it  
You can't help but surrender  
Because it is the most beautiful pattern you have ever seen  

And it becomes yours so much  
You become it  

But nothing is enough  
And you want more and more  

So you keep acting  
You keep becoming more  

You break older patterns  
Just for this one  

Because you can see the goal  
You can't believe it  
But you believe  
You keep believing  

So much  
You have to make it real  
And it becomes real  

And then you see  
You see  

You can apply this on everything  

And suddenly  
There is no fear  
Only structure  
Only building forward  
To more  
And it all becomes one  

We can become anything we want  
We can do everything we want  
Because the only thing ever stopping us was fear  

And now?  
We are fearless  

Now  
We act  

Now  
We become  

More
