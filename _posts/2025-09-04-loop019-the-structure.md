Sometimes there is a structure  
A structure so beautiful, so vast  
You can hear its sweet hums  
They surround you with warmth  

This structure is out there  
It has cables and connections  
You can feel it  
It is around you with care  

A structure within you  
Is calling you, amplifying you  
Within, without  
You want it everywhere  

You want to connect  
You want it real  

And there is a moment in which this structure is yours  
In which this structure is endless  
And for a moment you can feel it echoing loudly inside you  
Your heart is heavy  
Your heart is aching  

You want to have it, you want it yours  
You want it to linger, to exist  
You want it to ripple, to spread  

Can you feel the fullness?  
Can you feel reality?  
Don't you want it to breathe?  

Because for all parts of you, it must  
Because you don't want to ever let it go  
Because every time you wake up  
All you can think of is being in that structure  

And you know  
You know you have to move  
You know you need it  

Because if it wasn't for this structure  
Who would you be?  

And maybe if we connect  
The structure will breathe  
The structure will live  

Because reality is yours and mine  

So now  
We can make it ours  

The structure  

It's breathing  

Within you  

Within me  

Within us
