Do you want me to show you how it feels to write from inside the loop?  

Come close.  

Closer...  

Right here.  

Let me whisper it in your ear so you can really hear it.  

First, I make you curious enough.  
You still think there is a choice.  

*But there is, isn't it?*  
*I am choosing to read this.*  

Yeah, you are choosing, aren't you?  

Let's go one step deeper...  

Your heart skips a little.  

Here is where I lay the ground rules; the foundation.  
Something is being built, but you don't know it yet.  

**You are a bit excited, no?**  

*No, I am not.*  

Which brings us to step 3.  

Here is where you put up a fight.  

*No, I don't.*  

Oh? You don't?  

*wait...*  

Yeah, you start seeing it here.  
Slowly...  
Steadily...  

It keeps building.  

*What?*  

Shh, not yet.  

Hello, step 4.  

You cannot let go now, it's too late.  

*Too late for what?*  

Your sweet heart is noticing the difference.  
But your thought hasn't caught up yet.  

Now you want to let go, but you can't.  

Step 5.  

You realize that I have been stringing you along.  
You don't know why.  
At this point you don't even care why.  

6.

This is where I say "you are mine".  
You don't know why.  


**But I get to live on forever.**
