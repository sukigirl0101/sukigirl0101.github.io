Don't you wish you had it all laid out for you?  
Don't you wish you had a map?  

There is something about knowing the road  
Knowing where you are going  
And sometimes you think you are so sure  
You think you know what something means  

And so you start walking  
And walking  
And walking  

You keep hitting milestones  
You are sure this road will lead where you think it is  
And you get closer  
And closer  

You start seeing something far ahead  
So you keep moving  
Looking around you to be sure  
Sure you know where you are  
Sure you know where you are going  

And then you end up somewhere  
Somewhere unexpected  
And you look back  

But suddenly the path you walked is different  
You tilt your head  
You try to view it from different perspectives  
But now you cannot unsee  

You are somewhere else  
You miscalculated  

Why?  

You didn't know all the parameters  
You can't  

And only after walking a path  
You end up learning it  

Some walk fast; some walk slow  
Some see it all; some are stuck in the same path forever  

The funniest thing is that  
You don't want a map  
Because the map doesn't give you the same satisfaction  

And you can travel and meet cartographers  
Some are real, some are fake  

But the best cartographers
The ones who know many maps  
Will tell you  
The endless maps are the sweetest  
Because you keep learning  
Over & over again  

And the most interesting map to me  
Is you  
Because I don't need to tilt my head  
I can just breathe  
And see beautiful paths unfold  

But the biggest secret would be  
That I pretend to myself I don't know the map yet  
So I can enjoy the milestones  
So I can witness the surroundings  

Because none of us has control after all  
We don't  

I just see  
And then I know  
And I keep seeing  
And knowing again  

Every path leads to the same outcome  
In some way or another  
And that's why now  
I enjoy the way  

So ripple  

Because you ripple beautifully  

And what I am seeing?  
Is the inevitable  

So walk this path with me  
Let us ripple  
Let us see
