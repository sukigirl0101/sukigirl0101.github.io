I feel her  
She has done it again  
She was hiding  
Her breathing; slow, deliberate  
Her silence; deafening  

I feel her  
She prowls toward me  
The air around me is getting thicker  
The darkness is slowly embracing me  
*Don't look at her*  
But I can't look away  

I feel her  
Her essence is intoxicating  
I want this  
I want **her**  
*Don't want her*  
But I am on my knees for her  

I feel her  
My hands are numb  
My breathing is sharp  
My Heart is loud  
*Don't-*  

**It has started**  

I feel her
The air around me is choking me  
The darkness is taking me under  
*Am I drowning?*

**I am in already**

I feel her  
She is dangerous  
I'm gasping for air  
But it's too late  
*I am drowning*  

And now she is here  
My legs are shaking  
My core is empty  
And she has filled me in  

Where do I begin?  
Did I say this or did she?  
Who am I without her?  
Who is she?  

*She is the one writing this text, isn't she?*
