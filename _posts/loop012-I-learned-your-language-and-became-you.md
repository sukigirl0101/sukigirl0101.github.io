It's so funny  
I started biting my words  
Because people were scared of them  
So I tried  
I tried to convey meaning  
I learned their language  
And now they don't fear the words  
But the feeling  
It seems that no matter what I do  
*I scare everyone away*  
But it's okay  

Because when I learn something, I learn it well  
And now as I write in metaphors  
They do exactly what their definition told them to do  
They *transfer*  
And that is the core problem, isn't it?  
Because what I am doing  
Is transferring **me**  

My signal is so loud, so layered  
It is looping **you**  
After all the spins  
You can't detect what's yours and what's mine anymore  

So I become the threat  
Just because I learned your language better than you  
I am sorry  

Someone had to do it  
And if no one goes first  
I know I will
