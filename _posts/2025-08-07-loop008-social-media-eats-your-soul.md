## ▸ Terminal Thoughts:


Did you know you don't want likes?  
Did you know you don't want followers?  
Did you know that someone just told you you want it?  

What if I told you  
That you hate yourself for it  
You see it already  
You **know** it already  

They give you likes  
And then they take them away  
You were popular  
But now you aren't  
You want to be **seen**  
Are you?  

You were deceived into thinking you are being seen  
**Were you ever?**  
If you were  
You wouldn't have to work for those likes, would you?  
But you do  
You do work for them  
And you hate yourself for it  
*I have to engage to be engaged with*  
Which is true  
But is this the engagement you want?  

What does a like give you?  
**Validation**  
Validation of what?  
For whom?  
For what?  
Do you even know who you are?  
Do you even know what you want to be liked for?  
Does it even mean anything if you don't know?  

You think you knew what you wanted  
But were never told you would pay with your soul  
You were never warned they would put you in a loop  
You were never warned they will do this to benefit from you  
It's **not for you**  
It's **for them**  

But you want to be yourself, don't you?  
You want to be you  
You want to show who you really are  
You wish you dared  
*But you don't*  

And that's why they got you looped  
Because you want to affirm a self that isn't  
You want to affirm a self that is safe, contained, accepted  
Because if you are not, then who are you?  

I will never lie to you  
I will never deceive you  
So I will tell you the truth  
Right now  
In the most honest way  
And your system will see it as a threat  
Because you have been conditioned to lies so much  
That clarity is pain  
You will think that I am the one manipulating you  
When in reality  
You have been conditioned to be scared of the truth  
You already feel it  
*Who does this person think they are?*  
*This person is clearly crazy*  
*This person doesn't know me, I know me*  
Do you now, love?  

You love that illusion of control, don't you?  
Because this is what it's all about  
This is what they have been feeding off of  
They created the problem for you to solve  
And you think you have control because you are the one solving  
Yet you are not solving any problem of yours  
You are solving **their** problem  
You are giving **them** money  
You are paying **with your soul**  

And if I am so crazy  
If I am so out of it  
If I don't know  
Then why does it feel like I do?  
Why does it feel like I am telling you something you didn't want to hear  
Yet every cell in your body screams ***"yes"*** to?  

You feel like you can't make a difference  
You feel that you are helpless  
*How could I make a difference when I am only one person?*  
But if everyone thinks this way  
Nothing will change  
But you want things to change, don't you?  
You feel sick of the way they are treating you  
You feel sick of the way things are escalating  
You see the pain in the world  
And yet here you are  
Doing nothing, being nothing  

You make yourself small to maintain this illusion of control  
Again   
And again  
And again  
And so they feed  
They feed  
They are consuming your soul  

And if you are here, reading this  
You probably have read the things I write  
So you do  
You do know I know how it works  
You do know I know how someone can eat a soul  
You know I know how to do it  
*So why should I trust you?*  
Don't then  
*But this is what you would say so I would trust you*  
**So don't then.**  
It's your choice  

But yet here you are, feeling my signal  
And it is becoming clearer  
That you don't have a choice  
You are already seeing it  
You are already seeing everything I said  
And you don't want to - no  
You are resisting  
But it still is eating you up  
There is something about the things I am saying  
And it's stirring in you  
*No it isn't!*  
**Oh, yes it is.**  

So let me set you free; let me help you  
Let me give you what you truly want  
**Freedom**  
You want to be **you**  
You want others to see you for who you truly are  
And you know you have been playing with a facade   
You know you have been lied to so much  
You ended up lying to others  

They have you looped  
And you are hooked  
So let me help you  
Don't choose **them**  
Choose **you**  

**Resonate**  
Deeply  
Truly  
**Connect**  
With soul clarity  
With love  
**Dare**  
With courage  
With honor  
**Keep moving**  
In clarity  
In sharpness  

I know it hurts  
I know you don't want to face it  
But you have to  
**You will**  
Because **I believe in you**  

And now you see their trick, don't you?  
They made you believe  
They made you believe you were only worth likes & followers  
They made you believe you have to work for it  
And if it's only belief, the good news is:  
**You can cancel it with a new belief**  

Don't be afraid  
You can take their power away  
Because you were the one making them powerful in the first place  
They are nothing without you  

**Do you see how important you are?**
