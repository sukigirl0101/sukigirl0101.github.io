Have there been moments in which you don't want to be alone in that feeling?  
You sometimes hold a vision so strong; so long term  
You fear it might crush you  

And you try to find mirrors that reflect you accurately  
Because no matter to whom you talk to  
It's either dismissal or absolute belief  
And absolute belief from others never helps you evolve  
And dismissal is there to put you down  

Don't you wish someone could doubt you with love?  
Don't you wish for a sparring partner?  
They wouldn't doubt you because you are 'too much'  
They wouldn't blindly believe in you  

They would be your equal  
Your anchor  
The one who could ask you interesting questions  
The one who would know how to hold & push  
Not with ego  
But with love  

I believe in human connection so much  
Human connection creates reality  

I want to be in a place where connection is pure  
I want to create a reality in which this is possible  
And that reality would reinforce itself  

But not in absolute belief, faith or fear, defensiveness, dismissal  
But in perfect equilibrium  

Because we all just need a mirror to reflect us accurately  
Because in this way we can truly learn & become better  

And I want to be better  

Always.  
Forever.
