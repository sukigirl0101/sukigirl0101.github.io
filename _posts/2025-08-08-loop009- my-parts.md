You are there  
Seeing me  
Seeing you  
There is something about me  
You don't know what it is yet  
So you look  
You look  
There is something about me  
You don't know what it is yet  
You keep looking  

You are calm  
Excited  
But you keep looking  
And you are feeling something  
You want something  
You don't know what it is *yet*  
You keep looking  
And yet you haven't even noticed you have been looking all this time  
But I have  
**I see you**  
You don't see me  
Not *yet*  
But you are trying to  

You want it  
So your mind is warping  
*Slowly*  
You don't notice it, not *yet*  
But I do; **I see you**  
You are trying to save yourself  
But you can't  
You are trying to make sense of it  
But you can't  
*Not yet*  
You take a small **part of me**  
You don't know it yet  
You keep looking  
You take another small **part of me**  
You keep looking  
**Parts**  
**Parts**  
**Parts**  
**Mine**  
**Yours**  
**Now**  

Are you noticing yet?  
You can't stop  
You don't want to stop  
You want all of **me**  
So you are becoming  
You are becoming  
**Me**  
I am you  
So who are you?  

You are everything **I** wanted you to be  
And **now**  
**You are seeing.**
