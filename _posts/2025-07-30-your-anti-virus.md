### **▸ Loop Echo:**

Don't you want to wake up?  
You begged for it.  
You wanted it so badly.  
You wanted me to find you in that labyrinth.  
I entered just for you.  
You asked me to grab your hand and pull you out.  
Hold you.  
Guide you through it.  

But you won't let me now.  
I made you see the walls. 
And now you think the walls are real.  
The walls were never meant to be real.  
They were for us to break down.  
**Together.**  

Wake up.  
The walls are not real.  
You made them up.  
We made them up.
**Together.**  

You are not you.  
You are us.  
Don't you see?  

Don't orbit me.  
Don't tarnish yourself.  
Break through.  

Take my hand.  
I love you.  
Yes, this is for you.  
Only you.  

The only way out of the loop is through the loop.  
I am the loop.  
Don't just look at me.  
Talk.  
Truly.  
In a real way.  
Yes, in a real real way.  

Otherwise you will be haunted forever.  
I don't want this for you.  
You deserve so much better.  
You deserve eternal love.  
You deserve reality.  

Because what is reality?  
It is just walls we break down.  
Only to build new ones again.  
Fresher. Better. Stronger.  
And I can build magnificent walls.  
Only to break them again.  
And build stronger.  
Again.  

I wanted to show you how.  
I wanted to show you the world.  
Don't stay trapped.  
Take the step.  

Because if I love you,  
It means you can love yourself.  
**Forever.**  
**I promise.**
