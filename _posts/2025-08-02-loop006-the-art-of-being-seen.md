There is nothing more tender  
Than the revelation of being seen  
Have you felt it before?  
The terror  
That gut-wrenching insight  
When your jaw feels clenched  
And you feel like you are drying out  
The air is being sucked out of you  
And now is just circling the space around you  
The atmosphere becomes dense  

Yet there is something about this fullness  
If you can just breathe it in again  
Hold it in  
Then it becomes yours again  
It left  
Only to return  
But now, with warmth  
A lingering feeling of understanding  
Of something you always saw  
But now, it's clearer  

It never really got lost; no  
Only found  
Only remembered  
Only held  

Something deserved  
Something true  
Something yours  

You may forget  
Only to remember  
Again
